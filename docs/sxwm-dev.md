### Functions

Below, each entry shows the compact signature and a detailed description. Use anchors in the table to jump here.

#### add_client

```c
(Window w, int ws) -> Client *
```

> Returns NULL on allocation failure.

Create and register a client in workspace ws. Select inputs, grab mouse
buttons, set protocols (WM_DELETE_WINDOW), capture initial geometry, set
monitor by cursor position, set _NET_WM_DESKTOP, and raise the window.
Sets global focus if it is the first client in the current workspace.

#### apply_fullscreen

```c
(Client *c, Bool on) -> void
```

Enter: save geometry, clear floating, set fullscreen, remove borders,
resize to monitor bounds, raise, set EWMH state. Exit: restore geometry
and border, clear state, recompute monitor if tiled, then retile and
repaint borders.

#### centre_window

```c
(void) -> void
```

If the focused client exists, is mapped and floating, move it to the
center of its current monitor workarea and apply via XMoveWindow.

#### change_workspace

```c
(int ws) -> void
```

Abort if ws is invalid or already current. Grab server. Remember which
scratchpads are visible and unmap them. Unmap all non-scratchpad windows
in the current workspace. Switch current_ws, remap windows in the target
workspace, move visible scratchpads into the new workspace, and map them.
Retile, choose focus (prefer visible scratchpad, else first window on the
current monitor), set input focus, update _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP and
per-client _NET_WM_DESKTOP. Ungrab server and sync. Maintain
previous_workspace and in_ws_switch flags.

#### check_parent

```c
(pid_t p, pid_t c) -> int
```

Walk the process tree via get_parent_process until p or 0 is reached.
Return c if p is an ancestor of c, else 0.

#### clean_mask

```c
(int mask) -> int
```

Strip LockMask, NumLock, and Mode_switch bits so key matching is stable.

#### close_focused

```c
(void) -> void
```

If focused exists, clear scratchpad binding if any. If the client supports
WM_DELETE_WINDOW, send a ClientMessage. Otherwise unmap and kill the
client. Layout updates are handled by subsequent notifications.

#### dec_gaps

```c
(void) -> void
```

If user_config.gaps > 0, decrement and retile, then repaint borders.

#### find_client

```c
(Window w) -> Client *
```

Linear search across all workspaces for a client with top-level window w.

#### find_toplevel

```c
(Window w) -> Window
```

Walk up the X window tree via XQueryTree until the root parent is reached
and return that top-level window id.

#### focus_next

```c
(void) -> void
```

From the current focus (or head), loop forward (wrap) to the next mapped
client on current_mon. If found, set focus and call set_input_focus.

#### focus_prev

```c
(void) -> void
```

From the current focus (or head), walk backward (wrap) to the previous
mapped client on current_mon. If found, set focus and call set_input_focus.

#### focus_next_mon

```c
(void) -> void
```

If multiple monitors, focus the first mapped, non-fullscreen client on the
next monitor. If none exist, warp the pointer to the next monitor center.

#### focus_prev_mon

```c
(void) -> void
```

Same as focus_next_mon but targeting the previous monitor.

#### get_monitor_for

```c
(Client *c) -> int
```

Compute the client center and return the monitor whose bounds contain it.
Fallback to 0 if none match.

#### get_parent_process

```c
(pid_t c) -> pid_t
```

Read /proc/%u/stat and parse the parent PID for process c. Return 0 on
failure.

#### get_pid

```c
(Window w) -> pid_t
```

Read _NET_WM_PID from the window as a 32-bit XA_CARDINAL and return it, or
0 if missing.

#### get_workspace_for_window

```c
(Window w) -> int
```

Check XClassHint against user_config.open_in_workspace rules. If a class
or name matches, return that workspace id. Else return current_ws.

#### grab_button

```c
(Mask button, Mask mod, Window w, Bool owner_events, Mask masks) -> void
```

Call XGrabButton with async mode on root and sync on non-root windows.

#### grab_keys

```c
(void) -> void
```

Ungrab all keys, then for each binding in user_config.binds, compute
keycode and grab with guard modifier combinations so bindings remain
usable with Lock, NumLock, or Mode_switch active.

#### hdl_button

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

ButtonPress handler. On tiled windows:

* Mod+Shift+Left: begin swap drag (DRAG_SWAP).
* Mod+Left or Mod+Right: toggle_floating to allow drag.
* Plain Left: focus the clicked window.

On floating windows, begin DRAG_MOVE (left) or DRAG_RESIZE (right),
recording drag origin and grabbing the pointer.

#### hdl_button_release

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

If in DRAG_SWAP and a target is set, swap clients, retile, and repaint.
Always ungrab the pointer and clear drag state.

#### hdl_client_msg

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Handle _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP by calling change_workspace. Handle
_NET_WM_STATE actions for _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN: add/remove/toggle via
apply_fullscreen and raise on entry.

#### hdl_config_ntf

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

On root ConfigureNotify, refresh monitors, retile, and repaint borders.

#### hdl_config_req

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Honor ConfigureRequest for floating or fullscreen clients by forwarding
geometry. Ignore for tiled clients (layout is enforced by WM).

#### hdl_dummy

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

No operation.

#### hdl_destroy_ntf

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Unlink the destroyed client. If it swallowed another, remap it. If it was
swallowed, remap the swallower. Pick a new focus on the same monitor if
possible. Update _NET_CLIENT_LIST, retile current workspace, repaint, and
refocus if applicable.

#### hdl_keypress

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Match keycode+mods (cleaned) against user_config.binds and dispatch:

* TYPE_CMD: spawn argv
* TYPE_FUNC: call function
* TYPE_WS_CHANGE / TYPE_WS_MOVE
* TYPE_SP_REMOVE / TYPE_SP_TOGGLE / TYPE_SP_CREATE
  Update _NET_CLIENT_LIST when workspace topology changes.

#### hdl_mapping_ntf

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Refresh keyboard mapping, detect modifier masks, and regrab keys.

#### hdl_map_req

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Ignore invisible or override-redirect windows. If already managed and on
current workspace, ensure mapped and optionally focus. Otherwise:
classify window type, decide floating or tiled (consider utility/dialog,
modal, size hints, transient), enforce max clients, choose target
workspace via rules, call add_client, set WM_STATE, center floating, set
borders, attempt swallowing (class rules + parent PID), honor requested
fullscreen, map if on current workspace, and update borders/focus.

#### hdl_motion

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

Throttle by motion_throttle. Identify monitor under pointer. For DRAG_SWAP
track hovered tiled target and show swap border. For DRAG_MOVE compute new
position, apply snapping inside monitor workarea, auto-toggle to floating
if moved far enough, and move window. For DRAG_RESIZE grow from bottom
right and clamp to monitor workarea.

#### hdl_property_ntf

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

On root:

* _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP: read and change_workspace.
* _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL: update_struts, retile, repaint.

On client:

* _NET_WM_STATE: mirror fullscreen flag using apply_fullscreen.

#### hdl_unmap_ntf

```c
(XEvent *xev) -> void
```

If not switching workspaces, mark the client as unmapped. Update client
list, retile, and repaint.

#### inc_gaps

```c
(void) -> void
```

Increment gaps and retile, then repaint borders.

#### init_defaults

```c
(void) -> void
```

Fill default_config (modkey, gaps, border colors via parse_col, movement
steps, per-monitor master widths, rule arrays, throttles, snap distance,
and flags). Copy to user_config.

#### is_child_proc

```c
(pid_t parent_pid, pid_t child_pid) -> Bool
```

Walk PPID chain up to a limit using /proc. Return True if parent_pid is
found. Print simple diagnostics on failures.

#### move_master_next

```c
(void) -> void
```

Rotate the head node to the tail of the current workspace list. Retile,
optionally warp to the old focused window, send WM_TAKE_FOCUS, repaint.

#### move_master_prev

```c
(void) -> void
```

Move the tail node to head (becomes new master). Retile, optional warp,
send focus, repaint.

#### move_next_mon

```c
(void) -> void
```

If focused and multiple monitors, reassign focused to next monitor. If
floating, center and clamp inside the target monitor. Retile and optionally
warp cursor. Repaint.

#### move_prev_mon

```c
(void) -> void
```

Same as move_next_mon but previous monitor.

#### move_to_workspace

```c
(int ws) -> void
```

Unmap focused, unlink from current list, push to target workspace head,
update _NET_WM_DESKTOP, retile current workspace, and refocus its head.

#### move_win_down

```c
(void) -> void
```

For a focused floating client, move by move_window_amt down via XMoveWindow.

#### move_win_left

```c
(void) -> void
```

For a focused floating client, move left by move_window_amt.

#### move_win_right

```c
(void) -> void
```

For a focused floating client, move right by move_window_amt.

#### move_win_up

```c
(void) -> void
```

#### other_wm

```c
(void) -> void
```

Temporarily set error handler to other_wm_err, attempt to select
SubstructureRedirectMask on root to detect another WM, then restore.

#### other_wm_err

```c
(Display *d, XErrorEvent *ee) -> int
```

> Always exits with failure.

Print a message and exit because another WM has the redirect. Returns 0
but does not reach caller.

#### parse_col

```c
(const char *hex) -> long
```

Parse and allocate an XColor from a hex string. On failure, return the
default white pixel. OR 0xff into the high byte to set an alpha-like
component and return the pixel.

#### quit

```

Close display and free cursors. Print a message and clear running flag.
Optional mass-kill code is commented out.

#### reload_config

```c
(void) -> void
```

re-parse config (fallback to defaults on error), regrab keys and buttons
on root and clients, rebuild root grabs, update desktop props and client
list, sync, retile, and repaint.

#### remove_scratchpad

```

Open display, set root, setup_atoms, probe for other WM, load defaults and
parse config, compute modifier masks, grab keys, run autostart, load and
set cursors, cache screen size, update monitors, select root events,
grab root mouse buttons, initialize event table, scan existing windows,
and ignore SIGCHLD to prevent zombies.

#### setup_atoms

argv pieces.

#### swallow_window

```c

geometry/floating state, move/resize swallowed if floating, retile and
repaint.

#### swap_clients

```c
(Client *a, Client *b) -> void
```

Swap two nodes in the singly-linked list of the current workspace,
handling the adjacent case and the general case.

#### switch_previous_workspace

```c
(void) -> void
```

Call change_workspace(previous_workspace).

#### tile

```c
(void) -> void
```

Recompute struts, then for each monitor: build list of visible, non-
floating, non-fullscreen clients on that monitor. Place master at left
with width master_width[m], stack on right with gaps. Compute stack
heights using per-client custom_stack_height or auto-split; enforce
minimums and absorb rounding remainder at bottom. Configure windows,
optionally raise floating windows, and repaint borders. Skip layout if a
single fullscreen client exists.

#### toggle_floating

```c
(void) -> void
